### Visual Narrative Project Overview

Over the rest of the semester, you will work towards creating a visual, interactive, data-driven story. Data storytelling is the process of describing data by building a compelling narrative around datasets that is supported by data visualizations. This adds meaningful context to the data and helps the audience easily understand the information.  

Additionally, data visuals have evolved over the past decade from static charts and graphs to interactive and immersive visuals. This allows the audience to modify elements of the data being presented and manipulate the graphical representation. Static charts and graphs do not have the capability to adjust the visual, such as hovering, sorting and scaling. Interactive visualizations allow users to generate transformative insights, identify relationships, view trends and create meaningful stories through data.  

In your work as data scientists, in addition to doing modeling and machine learning work, you will be responsible (either individually or as part of a team) for providing the following as part of a project:  

- **Findings**: what does the data say?  
- **Conclusions**: what is your interpretation of the data?  
- **Recommendations**: what can be done to address the question/problem at hand?  

Your narrative will focus primarily on the first two above. The narrative should allow your audience to be able to understand the topic you are analyzing, presenting and discussing.  

We do not expect you to tackle and solve a large-scale problem, that is not the objective. However, you are welcome to offer ideas and proposals on the topic you present. Find a topic of interest, work with the data, and present it to an audience that may not know very much about the subject using a data-driven narrative.  

This is your chance to show creativity and have some fun.  

## Inspiration

The following are exemplary projects from prior years. These do not necessarily include all of the same set of requirements you have this semester.  

- Example 1  
- Example 2  

You can also take a look at the Juice Analytics 20 Best Data Storytelling Examples for more inspiration.  

## Milestones

There are five major milestones. Click on each milestone for the specific instructions.  

1. **Dataset & topic proposal**  
   - You will propose dataset(s) to be used, the source(s), and the reason for using this dataset. You will also provide a short, yet thoughtful explanation of what you would like to do. We must approve your data and topic proposal before you can proceed, and we have the right to reject your proposal if it will not allow for a successful and comprehensive project.  

2. **Formal proposal**  
   - You will provide more details to your approach after we approve your data and topic.  

3. **Work-in-progress milestone**  
   - Most of the visualizations and narrative are developed in some form but not finalized. This is not a rough or first draft, and requires significant effort.  

4. **Final milestone**  
   - The interactive narrative with all of its final components in a working website.  

5. **Presentation**  

## Deliverables

The project will be delivered through an interactive self-contained website. The website and all of your code work will be done in your team’s GitHub repository. You will work in the same repository throughout the life of the project.  

Think of the entire project as several parts (for different audiences):  

- **The story**: a website with the visual narrative. This is the end product for a general audience where you will tell a story using storytelling and visualization techniques to an audience that wants to learn something about your topic.  
- **The technical approach**: the collection of code you used to process your data, create the visualizations, and produce the website. The audience for this piece is mainly the instructors, however, it is also important to the general audience for reproducibility.  
- **The presentation**: at the end of the semester where you will show the instructors and your classmates how to interact with your story and explain your process throughout the semester.  

## Overall Requirements

### Narrative

**Warning**  
A narrative is not a set of individual comments on every visualization. It is a story with structure, evolution, and flow, where the visualizations are used to support and strengthen the narrative.  

### Visualizations

For this project, the visualizations are just as important as the narrative. They must add context to the narrative and allow the audience to learn more about your story by visually understanding and interacting with the data. They should be used to describe and highlight aspects of the data and analyses that you describe in your narrative.  

Your final product must include the following elements:  

- At least five unique views, where a view is a visualization type. A view may also contain multiple plots.  
- At least one of these views must be an attempt of an innovative view.  
- At least two linked views. A click/hover/selection interaction within one view must trigger a change in a different view.  
- At least one view with interactive tooltips that are shown when users hover over marks. These tooltips must contain information that is not shown in the visualization itself, and must be properly formatted. Tooltips that just show coordinates and colors that are already explained in a legend are not satisfactory.  
- A formatted and/or interactive data table that presents part of your data in a pleasant and interactive way.  

### Design

You must apply best practices in design:  

- Your narrative must have custom theming, look and feel.  
- Choose appropriate color schemes and keep them consistent.  
- Add appropriate annotations.  

### Website

The website must:  

- Be self-contained in its own subdirectory within the repository (not the root level) and accessible via an `index.html` file; all required assets must be accessible and available for offline rendering.  
- Have navigation tools, allowing the user/visitor to explore all the contents and always know where they are, and return to the starting point.  
- Show the title of your visual narrative and the team members.  
- Not require server-side components.  

### Code and Workflow

We expect to see best practices in collaborative development and coding.  

- All team members must make git commits that are attributed to them.  
- Ensure that you have your git `user.name` and `user.email` configured properly with your GU information.  
- Use best practices in collaborative workflow (branches, pull requests, merges).  
- Make sure that your code is well-organized, documented with comments, and easy to read.  

### Tools

Allowed tools include:  

- `htmlwidgets` package in R  
- `bokeh`, `holoviz`, `altair`, `plotly`  
- Geospatial tools like `leaflet`, `tmap`, `folium`  
- `Observable`, `flexdashboard`  

Not allowed:  

- Any server-side or custom backends (Node.js, Python, etc) and database systems.  
- Highcharts JS  
- Shiny  

## Evaluation

The project will be evaluated using the following high-level criteria:  

- **Analytical approach**: are you making sound choices in your analysis?  
- **Visual effectiveness**: effectiveness of visualizations and interactions in adding value to your story.  
- **Design effectiveness**: effectiveness of design choices.  
- **Level of technical difficulty and quality of implementation.**  
- **Whether the visual narrative answers a question, tells a story, and addresses the goals and requirements.**  
- **Quality and clarity of your writing.**  
- **Overall presentation, including your own visual style.**  

The project will have several milestones that are cumulative in nature. Therefore, we will grade the project after the final submission with a holistic project rubric.  

Each team member will complete a peer evaluation for their group and provide feedback on everyone’s contribution. Every team member is expected to contribute equally to their project. If peer evaluations indicate that students within a team are not contributing equally, those students will receive a grade penalty and a lower grade than the rest of their team.
